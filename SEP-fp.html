            <p>On the day of the Elevator pitch presentation, I felt nervous but eventually Myron and I were able to be seen by the judges. Yet, before this, I had prepared my elevator pitch which I had struggled with since we were partnered up, meaning that we had to split the time. So when I communicated with him, we decided that he was going to pursue the introduction, and I was going to continue with the types of marketing section of the website. The real issue was finding how I was going to fit all the types of marketing techniques in that time frame(which in the end I decided not to, I only gave 1 example). During the presentation, we explained most of our project’s ideas but we lacked the navbar part(which was transparent), therefore when you scrolled down, the words mixed in with the information we had on the bottom. So, I decided that for future web designs, I will not make the navbar transparent so, words don’t mix together. 

	Fast forward to our in-class presentation, I was really confident since I had my hook ready and did not need to reference back to the slides all the time. Yet, my partner was nervous, so I tried to encourage him with a shoulder pat and “you got this”. We went through the slides and everything was going well until the end since our conclusion was not clear, and the future invention was not present in much of our project. Even from this though, we were able to at least describe what it was on the top of our heads. I will use this moment as a lesson in the future, so my takeaways are to double check the product to see what is lacking before submitting it. 

	I am now at the Improve section of the engineering design process since after our final product we still have some flaws which will be fixed and improvised. In addition, I am building on skill/skills like communication and Embracing failure. I have talked to my partner numerous times when we were unsure about our next steps(like when we decided to split the pitch for 2). In addition, embracing failure was welcomed, since I have remembered the mistakes we made, so I can improve in the future. Given the lessons learned, we will still continue to work together collectively to build off of one another’s ideas.
